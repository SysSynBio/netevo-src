NetEvo 2.0 (13th Jan 2012)
================
A complete rewrite of the library using C++ to enable easier development. The underlying
datatype is now based upon LEMON and alternative numerical integration and analysis
libraries have been chosen due to their flexibility and performance. Hooks have
also been included for future visualisation libraries, specifically Cinder. There are
some remaining performance issues around copying of systems which is slowing down
simulations that involve evolution of a network. These will be fixed in a later release.


NetEvo 1.0 (1 Jan 2011)
========================
The first full release containing several new areas of functionality. Dynamics can now
take the form of continuous and discrete time mappings. Further examples and developer 
documentation is included.


NetEvo 0.2 (31 May 2010)
========================
Major update to provide missing functionality from the initial 0.1 release. This
includes the ability to have node and edge attributes, and an updated form to
node and edge dynamics to allow for a wider range of dynamical networks to be
modelled. The main ne_sys interface to fairly stable now and users are recommended
to only use this when manipulating system structures. This release also has a 
fully working autoconf/make compilation routine which will simplify distribution.


NetEvo 0.1 (15 Aug 2009)
========================
This is the first beta release of NetEvo allowing for the evolution of
dynamical networks. The toolkit is currently under heavy development so expect
changes to interfaces until the release of version 1.0. Even so this should
provide some use to the networks community.
