NetEvo - Complex Dynamical Network Evolution
============================================

NetEvo is a computing framework designed to allow researchers to investigate 
evolutionary aspects of dynamical complex networks. By providing tools to 
easily integrate each of these factors in a coherent way, it is hoped a 
greater understanding can be gained of key attributes and features displayed 
by complex systems.

NetEvo is free software, you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the Non-Profit Open Software License ("Non-Profit OSL") 3.0. 
See the COPYING file for further details.

Availability
============

The current stable version of NetEvo is always available from:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/netevo/files/

Installation
============

NetEvo follows the standard GNU installation procedure. Please consult
the INSTALL file in this distribution for more detailed instructions.
We also provide projects for Windows (Visual Studio) and Mac OS X 
(Xcode) that may be more suitable for those unfamiliar with compiling
software from source.

For information about specific platforms and compilers see the
"Compilation Notes" section in the INSTALL file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: If you have boost, Eigen, igraph, odeint-v2 or other libraries 
      in a custom path you may need to set a custom include path. You  
      can do this using:
	  
	    export CXXFLAGS="-I/HEADER_PATH"
	    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/LIB_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	    
	    and replacing HEADER_PATH and LIB_PATH as required. This should
	    be set before running ./configure
